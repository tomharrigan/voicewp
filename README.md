# VoiceWP

Create Alexa Skills through WordPress

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/voicewp/Lobby)

VoiceWP is a WordPress plugin that integrates with Amazon Alexa to create and enable the creation of Alexa skills.

## How it Works

VoiceWP creates REST endpoints using the WordPress REST API. These endpoints handle all of the logic of your Alexa skills. When a user interacts with your skill, it sends a Request to an endpoint, which is processed by this plugin, and sends the Response back to the user.

Yourk skills and settings can easily be created and configured within the WordPress admin dashboard via the provided settings screen and meta fields.

For more on how Alexa skills work in general, [see here](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit).

## Requirements

- [Fieldmanager](http://fieldmanager.org).
- SSL certificate.
- Minimum version of PHP: 5.3.
- Minimum version of WordPress: 4.4.

## Installation

- Install and activate [Fieldmanager](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wordpress-fieldmanager/archive/1.0.0.zip).
- Download the .zip file of this repo and upload to your WordPress site by going to WP Admin and navigating to **Plugins -> Add New**. Select the 'Upload Plugin' button near the top of the top of the screen to upload the .zip file.

## Features

- 3 different types of skills can be created out of the box
	- __Flash Briefings__: Deliver original content to users as part of their flash briefing. For more on Flash Briefings, [see here](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/flash-briefing).

### Skills

#### Flash Briefing Skill

A Briefings post type is created which is intended to be used for the Flash Briefing skill.

The endpoint for this will be at:
`https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/voicewp/v1/skill/briefing`

#### Fact/Quote Skills

A Skills post type is created for generic skill creation. Out of the box, Fact/Quote skills can be created.

The endpoint for this will be at:
`https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/voicewp/v1/skill/(post_id)`

#### News Skill

This news/content skill will currently read the 5 latest headlines from your WordPress posts and allows the user to choose a post to be read in full.

The endpoint for this will be at:
`https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/voicewp/v1/skill/news`

### Settings

The main Alexa Skill Settings screen is located at __Tools -> Alexa Skill Settings__

![setting_menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27144151-c7ff3b2e-50fe-11e7-8043-431090ec8646.png)

The most important field that needs to be filled in for the news functionality to work is the `News skill ID` field. The Skill ID can be retrieved from the Amazon Developer Console:

![skill_id](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27146948-11a683cc-5109-11e7-9afc-502b85696cfa.png)

The top of the settings screen provides the ability to set and customize a number of messages used in the skill. The welcome message is triggered when a user opens your skill, for example 'Alexa, open Developer Quotes'. (This occurs by Alexa sending a 'LanchIntent' to your skill). The welcome message can prompt the user to take a certain action, or give them a brief intro to the skill.

The Help message should provide information for the different actions a user can take and occurs when the user asks for help. This occurs by Alexa sending a 'AMAZON.HelpIntent' to your skill.
e
The Stop message is completely optional. When a user asks the skill to stop or cancel, you can provide a parting message.

![intent_messages](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27147008-496cb858-5109-11e7-8565-91d288aab637.png)

Many sites have a set of abbreviations, acronyms, etc. That should be spoken differently by Alexa than how they appear in text. For example, the state abbreviation 'TN' should be pronounced as 'Tennessee'. A meta box with repeating field is available for you to define these words and phrases. Simply add the item in the first field, and how it should be read by Alexa in the second field.

![dictionary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27150410-23d9ebb8-5115-11e7-8938-e75fb4c4e2c1.png)

The tedious phase of creating your interaction model has been made simple by our plugin. To get you up and running quickly, the settings screen provides utterances, custom slot types, and an intent schema. The content of these fields can be quickly copied and pasted into the 'Interaction Model' tab for your skill in the Amazon Developer Console.

![interaction_model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27150639-fef6fcae-5115-11e7-8f47-8c776d37402f.png)

### Amazon Developer Console

First, head over to [https://developer.amazon.com] and sign in or create an account.

![amazon_developer_services](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27160213-8735fac8-5140-11e7-8b9d-025ac1532d8b.png)

Then click on the Alexa item in the navigation

![amazon_apps___services_developer_portal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27160221-a10376c4-5140-11e7-9ff9-9d7b80a6dcfe.png)

Then Alexa Skills Kit

![amazon_apps___services_developer_portal 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27160254-d2119192-5140-11e7-8c67-47149f0af49b.png)

On the right side, click the 'Add New Skill' button

![amazon_apps___services_developer_portal 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27160260-da44110a-5140-11e7-88c0-bd1f6a935841.png)

For the Skill Type, if you're setting up a Flash Briefing skill, select 'Flash Briefing Skill API', otherwise select 'Custom Interaction Model'.

![amazon_apps___services_developer_portal 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27160270-f085218e-5140-11e7-834c-0f829403dcb2.png)

Now, go to the next tab, Interaction Model. This is where, if creating a custom skill, you add your intents, custom slots and utterances. For the News skill, this is where the info we've included in the plugins' Alexa Skill Settings page come in, you can copy/paste the items into these field like so:

![interation_model_dev](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27160313-36726d28-5141-11e7-9315-063abb6430a8.png)

Next up is the Configuration tab. Choose HTTPS as the endpoint type. Select the appropriate region (North America or Europe), and then paste the endpoint URL. (For the news skill, this is `https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/voicewp/v1/skill/news`).

Last up is the SSL certificate tab:

![amazon_apps___services_developer_portal 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27160391-eb83b8fc-5141-11e7-9605-5524e0145e5f.png)

Now you're ready to test! Head over to the 'Test' tab, switch the toggle so that testing is enabled. Within the Service Similator, you can type in some utterances to make sure everything is working. For the news skill, try asking `what're the latest stories?`. Then hit the 'Listen' button in the lower right to hear Alexa deliver that response.

![amazon_apps___services_developer_portal 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27160473-97f23c3a-5142-11e7-9067-a9d98ad21ff1.png)

That's it, fill out the Publishing Information and Privacy & Compliance tabs as desired, and you're ready to rock.

A final note, when in this screen, the Skill ID is conveniently located at the top, for custom skills make sure you've added this to your settings within WordPress.

![amazon_apps___services_developer_portal 8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27160539-07066452-5143-11e7-9510-93dccddb0749.png)

### Creating your own custom skills

To create your own completely custom types of skills, there are two parts. First, register an endpoint. Second, have a function that gets called when the endpoint is reached.

Below is a simple Hello World skill to demonstrate how this can be accomplished.

```php
function hello_world_register_routes() {
	register_rest_route( 'voicewp/v1', '/hello-world', array(
		'callback' => 'hello_world_skill',
		'methods' => array( 'POST', 'GET' ),
	) );
}
add_action( 'rest_api_init', 'hello_world_register_routes' );
```

This registers the REST endpoint, defining the URL that our skill lives at. Our `hello_world_register_routes()` function is hooked on the `rest_api_init` action.

- The URL of this skill would be `https://{yourdomain.com}/wp-json/voicewp/v1/hello-world`
- When a request is made by Alexa to this URL, a function named `hello_world_skill` is called.

Now let's define our `hello_world_skill()` function:

```php
function hello_world_skill( WP_REST_Request $request ) {
	// Begin boilerplate
	// Allows us to leverage the core plugin to handle the grunt work
	$voicewp_instance = Voicewp::get_instance();

	// Prevents people from being able to hit the skill directly in browser. Only requests from Alexa are allowed.
	$voicewp_instance->voicewp_maybe_display_notice();

	// Validates that the request is coming from Alexa.
	// Gets the Alexa Request and Response objects for us to use in our skill
	list( $request, $response ) = $voicewp_instance->voicewp_get_request_response_objects( $request, 'add_your_amazon_app_ID_here' );
	// End boilerplate

	// This is the main functionality of your skill,
	// it formats the response that will be sent.
	$response
		// Alexa will read this out
		->respond( __( 'Hello world!', 'voicewp' ) )
		// The app card will say 'Hello from {your site name}'
		->with_card( sprintf( __( 'Hello from %s', 'voicewp' ), get_bloginfo( 'name' ) ) )
		// End the session since a user response is not being waited on.
		// Just say hello and then exit the skill.
		->end_session();

	// Send the result to the user
	return new WP_REST_Response( $response->render() );
}
```

The `hello_world_skill()` function begins with a few lines of boilerplate, each line above is commented to describe what it is doing. Don't forget to replace `add_your_amazon_app_ID_here` with your own app ID.

After the boilerplate is the main functionality of the skill. In this simple example, it is included directly here, but you may wish to break this out into a separate function in your own code.

The response is sent back to the user. Alexa will say 'Hello World!', in the users' app, there will be an app card that says 'Hello from {your site name}'. That's it, simple!

### Filter reference

#### voicewp_briefing_source_options

```php
apply_filters( 'voicewp_briefing_source_options', array $sources );
```

Allows for filtering the available sources that can be used for populating a flash briefing. Each source is a radio button option. This filter is only for adding an option to the radio buttons, it does not add a new field to the interface, see `voicewp_default_briefing_source`.

![briefing content source options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/784167/27094034-c8d53224-5036-11e7-8d82-44b503892fa8.png)

Parameters

$sources (array) Flash briefing source options. Array key is field name, value is text label.

Example:

```php
function my_voicewp_briefing_source_options( $sources ) {
    // To remove an existing source option
    unset( $sources['attachment_id'] );
    // To add a new source option
    $sources['my_url'] = __( 'My URL', 'voicewp' );
    return $sources;
}
add_filter( 'voicewp_briefing_source_options', 'my_voicewp_briefing_source_options' );
```

---

#### voicewp_default_briefing_source

```php
apply_filters( 'voicewp_default_briefing_source', string $default_source );
```

String defining the default content source of a flash briefing. The text area is the default source.

Parameters

$sources (string) The default selected content source for a flash briefing. The string is the array key of the source option.

Example:

```php
function my_voicewp_default_briefing_source( $default_source ) {
    return 'my_url';
}
add_filter( 'voicewp_default_briefing_source', 'my_voicewp_default_briefing_source' );
```

---

#### voicewp_briefing_fields

```php
apply_filters( 'voicewp_briefing_fields', array $children );
```

Allow addition, removal, or modification of briefing fields. The name of the meta field will be prefixed with `voicewp_briefing_`, so in the below example, the `my_url_field` will be saved as `voicewp_briefing_my_url_field`.

Parameters

$children (array) An array of Fieldmanager fields. The array of fields is a child of a Fieldmanager Group.

Example:

```php
function my_voicewp_briefing_fields( $children ) {
    $children['my_url_field'] = new Fieldmanager_Link( __( 'HTTPS URL to my audio file', 'voicewp' ), array(
        'attributes' => array(
            'style' => 'width: 100%;',
        ),
        'display_if' => array(
            'src' => 'source',
            'value' => 'my_url',
        ),
    ) );
    return $children;

$source (string) The defined source of the briefing content. If this filter is reached, it's because a custom source is being used.

$post_id (int) Post ID

$post (object) Post object

Example:

```php
function my_voicewp_briefing_source( $response, $source, $post_id ) {
    $response['streamUrl'] = get_post_meta( $post_id, 'voicewp_briefing_my_url_field', true );
    return $response;
}
add_filter( 'voicewp_briefing_source', 'my_voicewp_briefing_source', 10, 3 );
```

Example:

```php
function my_voicewp_post_types( $post_types ) {
    $post_types[] = 'article';
    return $post_types;
}
add_filter( 'voicewp_post_types', 'my_voicewp_post_types' );
```
